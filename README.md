## Project Description: Fortune Teller

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental JavaScript concepts, including:

* **Functions:** Creating and using a function (`fortuneTeller`) to encapsulate the fortune-telling logic.
* **Conditionals (`if` statements):** Implementing different fortune rules based on the user's name and age.
* **Booleans:** Evaluating conditions within the `if` statements to determine which fortune to generate.

The program takes a user's name and age as input and generates a personalized fortune based on a set of predefined rules. This exercise reinforces the understanding of how to use JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic applications.
